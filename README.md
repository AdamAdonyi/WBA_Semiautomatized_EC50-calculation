# WBA_Semiautomatized_EC50-calculation
Human Whole blood treated with different compounds using different concentrations in order to determine EC50 (Half maximal effective concentration) values regarding different cytokines.


  1,Human blood was equally distributed onto a 96-well plate (225µl/well)
  
  2, Prediluted compounds were added to the wells respectively (25µl/well)
  
  3, After 24h incubation, plate was centrifuged and the serum part was collected (~50µl/well)
  
  4, Collected supernatant was used for cytokine measurment in an MSD system (in each well 10 different spots are ready to measure individual analyte concentration (IFNb, IL-10...) symulteniously)
  
  5, The titration allows to determine EC50 values regarding all secreted cytokines
